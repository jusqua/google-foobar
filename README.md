## Were's the other solutions?

It has been 6 months since I uploaded a solution and when I decided to go back to solving challenges, the service was down, the [foo.bar URL redirects to Google Careers](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) page.

Looking for an answer I found a [thread in Google Search Help](https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/261714267/google-foobar-bug-console-dissappeared?hl=en) that might explain the problem.

Maybe it will come back, maybe it won't.
